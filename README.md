# Sorting_algorithm

A simple yet effective sorting algorithm in `C++` using templates to support both vectors and arrays.

## Features

* Template-based implementation
* Support for standard arrays
* Support for vectors
* Ascending and descending sort
* Simple two-loop sorting algorithm

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

* Git installed
* G++ compiler installed
* Command line terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ho11ow1/Sorting_algorithm
```
2. Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd Sorting_algorithm
```
3. Compile the program
```bash
g++ Sorting_algorithm.cpp -o Sort
```
4. Run the program
```bash
./Sort
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:
* Make sure you're in the correct directory
* Verify G++ is installed: `g++ --version`
* Check if all source files exist
